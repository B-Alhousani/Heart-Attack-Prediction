# Heart Attack Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), multiple model training, and performance evaluation.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
- Loading and cleaning the dataset
- Performing EDA through visualizations like heatmaps, bar charts, and box plots
- Preprocessing (handling nulls, duplicates, scaling)
- Training multiple models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- Evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and precision

## Features

- Multiple model training and comparison
- Visual exploration of feature relationships
- Feature importance analysis
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

## How to Run

This notebook is designed for use in **Google Colab**:

1. Upload and open the `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Ensure necessary libraries are installed (e.g., `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow`)
3. Execute cells in order to follow the full pipeline from EDA to model evaluation

## Output

- Model performance comparison based on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and precision
- Insights into feature importance and model behavior
